# pocket-fhir

## All of this is based on the fabulous [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/), but designed for FHIRÂ®

## Branches
1. local - this is a branch that just contains the src files and the executable.
2. local-docker - essentially just the same as local except that it runs in docker


### Local Branch
- Can just be run directly, can also be regenerated
- To regenerate: $ ./generate.sh
- To run: ./pocketfhir serve

### Local-Docker Branch
